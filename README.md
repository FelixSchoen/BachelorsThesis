# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the practical part of my [Bachelor's Thesis](https://github.com/FelixSchoen/BachelorsThesis/blob/master/BachelorsThesis.pdf), written in the summer semester of 2020. The goal was to create an application capable of composing (piano) music using neural networks.

## Dependencies
These technologies were used during the course of the project. In order to generate new pieces, a capable graphics card and a fitting version of CUDA is highly recommended.

 - Python 3.7.7
 - Mido 1.2.9
 - Tensorflow 2.1
 - CUDA 10.1
 - cuDNN 7.6.5
## Results
The [samples](https://github.com/FelixSchoen/BachelorsThesis/tree/master/samples) folder contains a few different audio files generated using the program. An in-depth explanation can be found in the thesis itself.
